## Installation

### Initial Configuration
#### Flask

1. Clone repository
    ```bash
    https://github.com/etkndr/noiseframe.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    pipenv install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Create a **.env** file based on the example with proper settings for your
   development environment
    - Make sure the SQLite3 database connection URL is in the **.env** file
    - The env example organizes all tables inside the `flask_schema` schema, defined
        by the `SCHEMA` environment variable.  Replace the value for
        `SCHEMA` with a unique name, **making sure you use the snake_case
        convention**.
    <br></br>

4. Start shell, migrate and seed your database, and run Flask app

   ```bash
   pipenv shell &&
   flask db upgrade &&
   flask seed all &&
   flask run
   ```

#### React

After your backend setup is complete, you can start your React application. Open a new terminal, and enter the following commands:

  ```bash
    cd react-app/ &&
    npm install &&
    npm start
  ```

At this point, the application should be up and running, and will be available in your web browser at http://localhost:3000/
